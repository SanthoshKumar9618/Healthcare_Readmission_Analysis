# 🏥 Hospital Readmission Analysis using Python, SQL & Power BI

## 📘 Project Overview
This project analyzes hospital readmission data to identify factors influencing patient readmissions and hospital efficiency.  
The analysis combines **Python**, **SQL**, and **Power BI** to build an end-to-end data analytics workflow — from data cleaning and exploration to dashboard visualization.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- **Python:** Data Cleaning, EDA, Feature Engineering (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **SQL (MySQL):** Querying, Aggregations, and Summary Reports
- **Power BI:** Dashboard Visualization and KPI Reporting
- **GitHub:** Version Control and Project Documentation

### 3️⃣ Diagnosis & Treatment Trends
- Top Diagnoses by Readmission Count  
- Scatter Plot: Lab Procedures vs Medications  
- Table: Diagnosis Code vs Readmission %

### 4️⃣ Hospital Operations Insights
- Average Length of Stay KPI  
- Histogram: Time in Hospital Distribution  
- Table: Admission Type vs Readmission Rate

---

## 📈 Key Insights
- Readmission rate is higher in older age groups and specific diagnosis categories.  
- Longer hospital stays correlate with increased readmission probability.  
- Certain admission types (e.g., Emergency) have higher readmission rates than elective ones.  
- Strong relationship between the number of medications/lab procedures and patient severity.
